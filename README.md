# Learning Management System (LMS) Project

## Overview
The **LMS Project** is a web-based Learning Management System designed to facilitate online education and course management. It provides a robust platform for administrators, instructors, and students to manage courses, track progress, and engage in educational activities. The system includes core web functionalities such as user authentication, payment processing, and AI-powered features, offering a seamless and interactive e-learning experience with advanced topic validation.

This project was developed to create a scalable and customizable LMS solution for academic or professional use.

## Features
- **Course Management**: Create, update, and manage courses with detailed descriptions, syllabi, and learning resources.
- **User Roles**: Supports multiple user types (Admin, Instructor, Student) with role-based access control.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor student progress with completion status, quiz scores, and course analytics.
- **Interactive Assessments**: Create and grade quizzes, assignments, and exams within the platform.
- **Payment Integration**: Secure payment processing for course enrollments or subscriptions.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login, registration, and password management system.
- **Discussion Forums**: Facilitate communication between students and instructors via course-specific forums.
- **AI-Powered Features**: Leverage AI capabilities (e.g., content recommendations, search) using Qdrant vector database.
- **Certificate Generation**: Automatically generate certificates upon course completion.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on desktop and mobile devices for a seamless user experience.

## AI-Powered Learning Support Team
The LMS Project integrates a sophisticated **AI Learning Support Team** to enhance the educational experience. This team consists of four specialized AI agents—**Professor Agent**, **Academic Advisor**, **Research Librarian**, and **Teaching Assistant**—powered by advanced technologies including Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language processing, SerpAPI for real-time web searches, and Gemini for content processing. All outputs generated by these AI agents are organized into dedicated Google Docs with specific titles, enabling users to easily manage and access their resources. These agents also leverage Qdrant’s vector-based search for intelligent topic validation, ensuring content remains relevant and aligned with modern educational standards.

- **Professor Agent**: This AI specializes in in-depth information retrieval and synthesis. It uses SerpAPI to search for high-quality, reliable sources across the web and processes them with Gemini to generate comprehensive, well-structured summaries. The resulting content is compiled into a Google Doc with a clear title (e.g., "Course Topic Summary: [Topic Name]") for easy reference, ideal for instructors or students needing detailed insights into complex subjects.
- **Academic Advisor**: This AI focuses on creating personalized learning pathways tailored to individual student needs. By analyzing a student’s goals, progress, and interests using LLMs, it designs customized study plans and schedules. These plans are exported as Google Docs (e.g., "Personalized Learning Plan for [Student Name]") to help students stay organized and on track with their academic objectives.
- **Research Librarian**: This AI excels in sourcing high-quality academic materials for research purposes. Utilizing SerpAPI to locate scholarly articles, books, and credible online resources, it processes these materials with Gemini to ensure relevance and accuracy. The curated resources are compiled into a Google Doc (e.g., "Research Resources for [Topic]") with proper citations, making it easier for students and instructors to conduct thorough research.
- **Teaching Assistant**: This AI generates tailored assignments and exercises based on the learner’s proficiency level. Using LLMs to assess student performance and Gemini to process relevant content, it creates customized quizzes, problem sets, or projects, which are saved as Google Docs (e.g., "Assignment: [Topic] - Level [Difficulty]"). This ensures that assignments are appropriately challenging and aligned with the student’s learning stage.

These AI agents collectively provide a dynamic, intelligent, and user-friendly support system for both teaching and learning.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Python with Django framework for robust server-side logic.

  - SQLite for core system data storage.
  - Qdrant for AI-powered features, such as vector-based search or recommendations.
- **Styling**: CSS with optional libraries like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS (if applicable).
- **Other Tools**: Git for version control, Python virtual environment for dependency management, SerpAPI for web searches, Gemini for content processing.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project locally, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (v3.8 or higher)
- Node.js (v16.x or higher)
- npm or Yarn
- SQLite (included with Python, no separate installation needed)
- Qdrant (for AI features; can be set up locally or via a cloud instance)
- Git
- A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

## Environment Setup
To configure the project, you need to set up environment variables for both the backend and frontend, as well as a Google OAuth `credentials.json` file for the backend. Below are the steps to create and configure the `.env` files and the OAuth credentials.

### Backend Environment Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file by copying the provided `.env.example` (if available) or create a new one:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Edit the `.env` file with the following required variables (adjust values as needed):
   ```
   MAILGUN_API_KEY=your_mailgun_api_key
   MAILGUN_SENDER_DOMAIN=your_mailgun_domain
   FROM_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   VNPAY_TMN_CODE=your_vnpay_tmn_code
   VNPAY_HASH_SECRET=your_vnpay_hash_secret
   VNPAY_PAYMENT_URL=https://sandbox.vnpayment.vn/paymentv2/vpcpay.html
   FRONTEND_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
   PAYPAL_SECRET_ID=your_paypal_secret_id
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
   QDRANT_API_KEY=your_qdrant_api_key

   - `VNPAY_TMN_CODE`, `VNPAY_HASH_SECRET`, `VNPAY_PAYMENT_URL`: For VNPay payment integration.
   - `FRONTEND_SITE_URL`: URL of the frontend application.
   - `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `PAYPAL_SECRET_ID`: For PayPal payment integration.
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY`: API key for Gemini content processing.
   - `SERPAPI_KEY`: API key for SerpAPI web searches.
   - `QDRANT_API_KEY`: API key for Qdrant (if required).
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_FRONTEND_API`: For Clerk authentication services.
   - `DATABASE_URL`: SQLite database path (default is `db.sqlite3` in the backend directory).
   - `SECRET_KEY`: A secure, random string for Django’s cryptographic signing.
   - `DEBUG`: Set to `True` for development, `False` for production.

4. **Set Up Google OAuth Credentials**:
   - Create a `credentials.json` file for Google OAuth to enable Google Docs integration for AI-generated outputs.
   - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a project, and enable the Google Docs API.
   - Generate OAuth 2.0 credentials and download the `credentials.json` file.
   - Place the `credentials.json` file in the `backend` directory (ensure it is listed in `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive data).
   - Follow Google’s OAuth documentation for additional setup if needed (e.g., configuring OAuth consent screen).

### Frontend Environment Setup
1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file by copying `.env.example` (if available) or create a new one:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
3. Edit the `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=your_paypal_client_id
   VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
   VITE_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api
   ```
   - `VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`: Client ID for PayPal payment integration.
   - `VITE_REACT_APP_API_URL`: URL of the Django backend API.
   - `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `VITE_CLERK_FRONTEND_API`: For Clerk authentication integration.

> **Note**: Ensure sensitive keys (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `MAILGUN_API_KEY`, `VNPAY_HASH_SECRET`, `PAYPAL_SECRET_ID`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `SERPAPI_KEY`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`) are kept secure and not committed to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude `.env` files and `credentials.json`.
