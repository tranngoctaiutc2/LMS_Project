  - **Real-world Context**: A practical scenario (e.g., "In a hospital...", "In a financial app...") (1-2 sentences).  
  - **Difficulty**: Clearly state Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced.  
- Use `### Beginner`, `### Intermediate`, `### Advanced` for subsections.  
- Format as a markdown list with clear sub-bullets.

##### ‚ùì Quiz Questions  
- Provide **5-10 multiple-choice or short-answer questions**.  
- For each question, include:

  - **Description**: Explain the application (2-3 sentences).  
  - **Challenge Question**: Provide 1-2 challenge questions to apply the concept (1-2 sentences each).  
- Format as a markdown list with sub-bullets.

##### ‚úÖ Solutions & Explanations  
- Provide **detailed solutions** for all exercises, quiz questions, and challenge questions.  
- Include reasoning for each solution (2-4 sentences per item).  
- Format as a markdown list, aligning with the corresponding question or task.

#### üîó External References  
{references_text}

#### üõ† Additional Instructions  
- Use **enhanced markdown** for readability:  
  - `####` for main sections, `###` for subsections.  
  - Use `-` for bullet points, `**bold** for emphasis, and tables where appropriate.  
  - Add emojis (e.g., üìö, üéØ, ‚ùì) to make sections visually distinct.  
  - Ensure short paragraphs (2-4 sentences) and clear spacing.  
- Write in a **formal yet accessible academic tone** suitable for university-level learners.  
- **Maximize detail in every section** to provide robust practice materials, including specific examples or use cases.  
- Use provided references from SerpApi to inspire exercises, prioritizing high-quality, reputable sources.  
- If no references are provided, rely on reliable general knowledge to create exercises.  
- Avoid copying content verbatim from sources; write original exercises and solutions in your own words.  
- Ensure each exercise and question includes a **difficulty level** to guide learners.  
- Focus on beginner-to-intermediate exercises unless specified otherwise.
